Setting up the DevContainer","text":"<p>Setting up a Development (Dev) Container is important because it provides a standardized environment for software development. Preconfiguring your environment this way ensures that it is replicable across different machines, striving for consistency in setup. This essentially equips all contributors with the same \"development toolkit\". </p> <p>Most projects use external libraries or packages, speeding up the process by making use of the resources provided by others. For this tutorial in go, the primary dependancy is <code>go mod</code>, which handles dependencies through two files, <code>go.mod</code> and <code>go.sum</code>.</p> <p><code>go.mod</code> is responsible for automatically tracking the dependencies of the project. <code>go.sum</code> is responsible for ensuring that every developer gets the same exact dependencies. You should regularly commit these files to your repository to make sure every collaborator has the same environment. Running the command <code>go mod tidy</code> reads the <code>go.mod</code> file, ensures the same dependencies are present, and then validates that against the <code>go.sum</code> file. </p> <p>Additionally, we will have a <code>devcontainer.json</code> file that defines a consistent development environment in which our code will run. This is done using a Docker image, which is a package containing everything necessasary to run our software, including code, runtime, libraries, and more. Below we detail the process.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/go-setup/#part-1-add-development-container-configuration","title":"Part 1 - Add Development Container Configuration","text":"<ol> <li>Open the <code>go-tutorial</code> directory in VS Code.
